When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

By using a remote repository, you can do work whenever you want from lots of different computers.  
You can also collaborate with a bunch of other differenet people.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

If you auto update to the remote repository, you might publically share code before it is read for distribution.  
Could cause a bunch of problems and confusions
