When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

By using a remote repository, you can do work whenever you want from lots of different computers.  
You can also collaborate with a bunch of other differenet people.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

If you auto update to the remote repository, you might publically share code before it is read for distribution.  
Could cause a bunch of problems and confusions

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

Fork is when you copy a repo from Github from another user to your personal Github branch.
Cloning is when you copy a repo from Github on to your local computer.  You usually copy from your own Github account, 
but you could do this with others as well.
Branches is when you divide your code (branch off into different directions) on your local machine

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

The benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally allows you to quickly
push and pull relative to github.
